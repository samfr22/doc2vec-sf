# Doc2Vec Implementation in Tensorflow

An incomplete implementation of Doc2Vec with the Tensorflow-Keras API. I was unable to continue working on the project, due to system crashes and repeated vague errors. I think the outline of the model is correct, but some small thing I am missing is starting to brick my computer.
