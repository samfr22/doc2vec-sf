# Doc2Vec Implementation in Tensorflow

Implementing the doc2vec network in Tensorflow. This will involve building on the existing word2vec model/network that currently exists in Tensorflow

Create encoding method for documents - one hot encoding that will also work to essentially create the input activation later
